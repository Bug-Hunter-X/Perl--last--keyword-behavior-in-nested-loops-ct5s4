This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in Perl involving the `last` keyword within nested loops. The provided `bug.pl` script showcases the unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.pl` offers a corrected version. The issue stems from the fact that `last` only terminates the *innermost* loop, not all enclosing loops as some might assume.  The solution illustrates proper loop control techniques.
